                        I am a Frontend-focused Software Engineer with 3 years of experience designing and building reliable, scalable web applications. My expertise lies in <strong className="text-slate-200 font-medium">React</strong> and <strong className="text-slate-200 font-medium">TypeScript</strong>, where I focus on crafting clean, reusable components and optimizing frontend performance.

                    <p>
                        I have extensive experience developing social platforms, admin dashboards, and subscription-based features. I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with backend and cloud teams to deliver end-to-end features that solve real-world problems.

                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or optimizing my development workflow with modern tools.
